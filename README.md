# Restcountries & Weather using fetch API.

1. Created html file and added script.js.
2. In script.js, I used fetch() API to get both rest countries data and open weather.
3. I used Bootstrap card to display the data on the screen.
4. I displayed the details of countries like Region, Capital, Population, temperature, weather, wind speed, latitude and longitude.
5. The js code is in the [script](./js/script.js) file.
